HTML::TableContentParser
========================



This module can be used to parse the content of tables in HTML text. The
parser returns an arrayref consisting of data for each table found
within the passed-in text.

The module looks for HTML table elements described at

  http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/tables.html


Each table is a hashref consisting of an array of headers, and an array
of rows. Each row consists of an array of cells, which each contain
data.

Currently, this module does not support nested tables.

The module inherits from HTML::Parser, which does all the grunt work.
